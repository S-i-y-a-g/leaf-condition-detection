# leaf-disease-detection
This project aims at solving challenges faced by farmers. It can do leaf disease detection into three categories : healthy,rusty and powdery and provide precautions based on that.

1. Dataset
   Dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset/data
   This dataset contains three labels, "Healthy", "Powdery", "Rust" referring to plant conditions. There is a total of 1530 
   images divided into train, test, and validation sets.

2. Neural Architecture:

The project utilizes a convolutional neural network, a type of deep learning model designed for image analysis tasks.
The neural network is trained to extract features from leaves, which are crucial for accurately determining the location and spread of condition and predicting type of condition.
